        <div className={styles.story}>
          Once upon a time, in the bustling city of Miami, there was a small
          flower shop nestled on a quaint street corner. The shop was run by a
          woman named Maria, who had inherited it from her mother. Maria was a
          skilled florist, and her shop was filled with the most beautiful
          flowers from all over the world. The scent of roses, lilies, and
          orchids wafted out onto the street, enticing passersby to step inside.
          Despite the hot and humid weather of Miami, Maria's flowers thrived.
          Her secret was the special blend of soil she used, which kept the
          flowers healthy and vibrant. One day, a young couple came into the
          shop. They were looking for the perfect bouquet for their wedding,
          which was just a few days away.Maria listened carefully to their
          requests, and with her expertise, she created a stunning arrangement
          that perfectly matched the theme of their wedding.
        </div>
        <div className={styles.story}>
          The couple was overjoyed with the flowers, and they recommended
          Maria's shop to all their friends. Soon, Maria's flower shop became
          the go-to spot for weddings and special events in Miami. As the years
          went by, Maria's reputation grew, and her shop became a beloved
          fixture in the community. People would often stop by just to admire
          the flowers and chat with Maria. Despite the challenges that came with
          running a small business, Maria never lost her love for flowers or her
          passion for making people happy. She knew that her shop was more than
          just a place to buy flowers; it was a place where memories were made
          and dreams came true. And so, Maria continued to tend to her flowers
          and serve her customers with a smile, knowing that her little flower
          shop in Miami was a special place that would always hold a special
          place in the hearts of her community.
